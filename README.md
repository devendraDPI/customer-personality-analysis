# Customer_Personality_Analysis
Customer personality analysis is a detailed analysis of customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors, and concerns of different types of customers. This helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to marketing a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.
